### Data set Analysis:

We start by loading in the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset into a json. This will reveal a small handful of microb species were present in more than 70% of people.

### Plotly steps:


• Using D3 library to read in the samples.json. Once read in we can use Javascript to manipulate the data.

• We created a horizontal chart that will display the relevent data based on the selection of the dropdown menu.

• The next chart loaded will be a bubble chart that will show the same, once updated the relavent data will be displayed.

• There is also on the side a Demographic table that will present more detailed data based on the selection from the dropdown.
